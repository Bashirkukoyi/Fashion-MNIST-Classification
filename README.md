# Fashion MNIST Classification

This repository contains code to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using both Python and R.

## Files

- `fashion_mnist_cnn.py`: Python script to build, train, and evaluate the CNN.
- `fashion_mnist_cnn.R`: R script to build, train, and evaluate the CNN.
- `README.md`: Instructions and information about the project.

## Instructions

### Python

1. Ensure you have Python installed. 
2. Install the required packages using `pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib`.
3. Run the `fashion_mnist_cnn.py` script to train the model and make predictions.

### R

1. Ensure you have R installed.
2. Install the `keras` package in R using `install.packages("keras")`.
3. Run the `fashion_mnist_cnn.R` script to train the model and make predictions.

## Predictions

Both scripts will output predictions for some images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The predicted class and the true class will be displayed.
